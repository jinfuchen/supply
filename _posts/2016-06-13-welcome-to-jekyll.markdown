Hair, Skin & Nails Gummies with Biotin help to maintain the health of normal hair and skin and support nail health. 
Biotin helps the body to metabolize carbohydrates, fats and proteins into an energy source for cellular activity. Our unique formula also helps in the development and maintenance of bones, cartilage, teeth and gums. Not to mention it helps in connective tissue formation and wound healing.
All this in a delicious, naturally flavoured, strawberry gummy.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
